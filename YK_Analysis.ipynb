    "* Defining Overall Conversion Rate, and Calculating\n",

    "* Building Predictive Model for Conversion at the Session-level\n",

    "Here would be the primary recommendations based on findings: \n",
    "1. Improve search relevance. Early in the notebook, we observed that converted customers move quickly through future search sessions during future bookings, while unconverted customers remain on higher volumes of searches without conversion. During the modeling portion of the notebook, we also see what 'num_search_terms' and 'num_searches' are the primary negative drivers in our conversion model. Next step would be to conduct further analyses and experimentation to achieve this.\n",
    "2. Double-down on building an accurate conversion model, either at the session-level, user-level, or both. There are many elements of the data that were not included in the preliminary model built above (e.g. locations, IP addresses, etc.) that may be beneficial. A robust conversion model can serve as the basis for product enhancements and future experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional data that would help: budget, cost, and metrics for listing quality. This would form a basis of prioritization (budget, cost) which could can be used to established weighted features. Listing quality, and similar metrics, would further distinguish user experiences across the funnel data."
